# traffictelligence
This project predicts traffic volume using machine learning, based on features like weather conditions, holidays, and time attributes. The model is trained using a Random Forest Regressor and deployed using a Flask web application. Users can input relevant conditions and receive a predicted traffic volume for that scenario.
